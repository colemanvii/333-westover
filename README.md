# 333 WESTOVER — COMMAND CENTER
**Clarksville, Mississippi**

- Presence > performance  
- Long view always  

## The Triad
### The Place
**333 Westover, Clarksville, MS** — a low-noise, high-signal anchor.  
Not a real-estate play. **Infrastructure.**

### The People (Founding Fellows — Class I)
- **Jack Butcher** — systems, clarity, structure

### The Steward
- **Cole** — primary steward and managing member

## How It Connects (One System)

- **Cole Calfee** → art made here  

## Status
- Acquisition: **In Motion**
- Structure: **Founder-led, fellow-supported**

## Next Clear Action
**This Week**
1) Send Jack message  
2) Send Keith message  

**Next 30 Days**
- Confirm owner / asking / path (buy vs option vs hybrid)

## Operating Principles
- Quiet authority  
- Human-scale living  
- Ownership that feels calm in the body  
- No forced pace, no dilution pressure  

## Jack Call Agenda (20–30 min)
**Open:** “Structure, not hype.”  
**Place:** why 333 Westover, long horizon.  
**System:** Haven ↔ physical anchor.  
**Ask:** founder-safe acquisition + ownership thinking.  
**Invitation:** Founding Haven Fellow (no duties, no content).  
**Close:** “See what lights up.”

## Fellows Charter (1 page)
A Fellow is a trusted human invited into early stewardship of Haven and its anchors.
- Not employees
- Not managers
- Not hype machines
- Presence > leverage

## Public Share (quiet)
I’m in the process of acquiring a small house in Clarksville, Mississippi.

Not as an investment.  
Not as a retreat center.  
Not as content.

As a place.

A listening post for art, conversation, and long-view living.  
A place to make work slowly and stay human in public.

A few friends will help steward it.  
Most people will never hear about it.  
That’s the point.

Some things only work when they’re small enough to be true.

— Cole

## Commander’s Note
This is not about buying a house.  
This is about giving your life a place to stand.
